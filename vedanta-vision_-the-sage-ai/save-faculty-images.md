# Faculty Images Setup Instructions

## Save the faculty images to these exact locations:

1. **Prof. Prathosh A P image** → Save as: `public/images/faculty/prathosh.jpg`
   - The first image (young man in blue shirt)
   
2. **Dr. Satish Prasad Rath image** → Save as: `public/images/faculty/satish.jpg`  
   - The second image (man with glasses in suit jacket)

## Steps:
1. Right-click and save the first faculty image as `prathosh.jpg`
2. Right-click and save the second faculty image as `satish.jpg`
3. Place both images in the `public/images/faculty/` directory
4. The website will automatically load the images

The code has been updated to:
- Display actual faculty photos in circular frames
- Include graceful fallback to icons if images don't load
- Maintain the elegant hover effects and styling
